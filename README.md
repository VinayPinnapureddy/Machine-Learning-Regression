# Machine-Learning-Regression

This repository represents different Regression Algorithms.

With this project we able to know which regression algorithm is well suitable for whcih type of problems.

# Description

In this project we explore regression techniques which includes :

1) Simple Linear Regression ( The very basic Regression algorithm )  ( Y = b1.X + b0 )

2) Multiple Linear Regression ( Y = b0 + b1.X1 + b2.X2 + ..... + bn.Xn )

3) Polynomial Regression

4) Support Vector Regression

5) Decision Tree Regression

6) Random Forest Regression

# Datasets

We use various datasets to address various type of problems where regression is applicable.
